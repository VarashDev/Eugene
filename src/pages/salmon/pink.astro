<h2>
    <strong>Introduction to Pink Salmon in Oregon</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Pink salmon, also known as "humpies" due to the distinctive hump males develop during spawning, are the smallest but among the most aggressive of the Pacific salmon species. Though not as commonly associated with Oregon as Chinook or Coho, pink salmon make rare appearances in rivers like the McKenzie and Willamette—especially in odd-numbered years like 2025.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike other salmon species that regularly return to Oregon's rivers, pink salmon runs here are more sporadic. That’s why when the timing is right, anglers across the Pacific Northwest get excited to pursue these powerful fish. The Eugene area, with its lush rivers and clean water, becomes a temporary home for these traveling salmon.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>The Life Cycle of Pink Salmon</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Pink salmon have one of the shortest lifespans among their kind—about two years. This means they always return in <strong>odd-numbered years</strong> to spawn. From the time they hatch to the time they return to freshwater, their entire lifecycle is built around this cycle.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Spawning Habits</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    They spawn in gravel-bottomed rivers and creeks with shallow riffles. These are the environments pink salmon favor, and luckily, some of Oregon's waters near Eugene offer just that.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Migration Patterns</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Pink salmon typically migrate from the ocean back to their birth rivers in late summer and early fall. These migrations are often influenced by water temperature, flow, and tide levels.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Odd-Year Runs Explained</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    In Oregon, pink salmon returns have been noted more frequently in odd years like 2021 and 2023. This means 2025 could bring another wave—perfect for those fishing near Eugene.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Historical Presence Near Eugene</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Historically, pink salmon are far more common in Puget Sound and the British Columbia coast, but occasional strong runs have reached as far south as Oregon. Anglers have occasionally reported catching pinks in the <strong>Willamette River Basin</strong>, including tributaries near Eugene.
</p>
<p>
    These appearances are rare but have increased slightly in recent years—possibly due to climate variations and shifting ocean conditions.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Prime Fishing Locations Around Eugene</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Looking to cast your line near Eugene? Here are some local favorites where pink salmon could appear:
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>McKenzie River</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    While not a primary pink salmon habitat, the McKenzie River has the cold, fast-moving water that salmon prefer.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Willamette River</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This major river runs right through Eugene and connects to larger watersheds. In high-run years, pink salmon might be caught here, especially closer to confluence points.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Nearby Tributaries and Creeks</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Smaller bodies like Amazon Creek and tributaries feeding into the Willamette may offer surprising catches when pink salmon venture inland.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Best Time to Catch Pink Salmon</strong>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Peak Months:</strong> Late <strong>August to early October</strong>

    </li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<h2>
    <strong>Sustainable Fishing Practices</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Fishing isn’t just about catching—it’s about conserving. Follow these practices to help protect Oregon's pink salmon:

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Catch and Release:</strong> Use barbless hooks and release fish quickly and gently.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Respect Bag Limits:</strong> Don't exceed the legal limit—even if the bite is hot.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Avoid Spawning Beds:</strong> Don’t wade into areas where fish are actively spawning.
