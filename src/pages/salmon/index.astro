    Best Salmon Fishing Spots Near Eugene
</h2>
<h3>
    McKenzie River Highlights
</h3>
<p>
    The <strong>McKenzie River</strong> is a gem for both fly and spin anglers. Known for its clear waters and strong Chinook runs, this river is accessible and scenic. Prime spots include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Leaburg Dam
    </li>
    <li>
        Hendricks Bridge Park
    </li>
    <li>
        Hayden Bridge
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Willamette River Access Points
</h3>
<p>
    Flowing right through Eugene, the Willamette River is often overlooked. However, its back channels and deeper pools are productive for both Coho and Chinook. Try:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Alton Baker Park
    </li>
    <li>
        Valley River Center stretch
    </li>
    <li>
        Beltline Bridge area
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Coastal Trips Worth the Drive
</h3>
<p>
    While not in Eugene proper, coastal rivers like the <strong>Siuslaw</strong>, <strong>Umpqua</strong>, and <strong>Alsea</strong> are within 1-2 hours and offer trophy-sized salmon. These rivers light up during the fall Coho run.
</p>
<h3>
    Hidden Local Gems and Tributaries
</h3>
<p>
    For solitude and a higher chance of hooking wild salmon, explore:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mohawk River
    </li>
    <li>
        Row River
    </li>
    <li>
        Fall Creek
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These tributaries often fly under the radar but can offer big rewards.

    Top Techniques for Salmon Fishing in the Region

    Popular lures include:
