<h3>
    <strong>1. Fern Ridge Reservoir</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Oregonâ€™s largest lake at ~9,000 acres, located 12 miles west of Eugene 
    </li>
    <li>
        Excellent largemouth and smallmouth bass, especially in spring when spawningâ€”target weedy shallows, creek inlets (like Coyote Creek), lily pads, and dam rockðŸŽ£ 
    </li>
    <li>
        Boat ramps at Richardson Park, Orchard Point, Perkins Peninsula; also accessible from the dam and parksâ€”great for families and kayakers&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>2. Delta Ponds</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        A ~150-acre wetland complex in north Eugene, offering excellent bank access and a serene urban setting
    </li>
    <li>
        Home to largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, and catfish; clear water habitats, fishing platforms, restrooms, and gravel trails make it great for casual outings 
    </li>
    <li>
        Tips: fish weed edges and undercut banks; follow barbless-hook rules to protect wildlife
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>3. Dorena Reservoir</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Southeast of Cottage Grove (~30 miles from Eugene), over 1,800 acres 
    </li>
    <li>
        Produces trophy largemouth bass (up to 8 lbs) around reed canary grass, root wads, and structural edges
    </li>
    <li>
        Offers year-round opportunity; shoreline or boat access makes it tournament-worthy&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>4. Cottage Grove Lake (Row River Impoundment)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Also near Cottage Grove, smaller than Dorena but regularly stocked and full of bass, bluegill, and crappie 
    </li>
    <li>
        Accessible by boat or shore; stocked frequently for trout but warmwater species thrive during spring and summer .
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>5. Dexter Reservoir</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Just 22 miles southeast of Eugene, stocked with trout and also hosting bass 
    </li>
    <li>
        Banks and boat docks offer kid-friendly, family outings with mixed catch potential&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>6. West Kirk Park &amp; Kirk Pond</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Located downstream of Fern Ridge Dam; accessible via park trails 
    </li>
    <li>
        Contains largemouth bass, catfish, crappie, and panfishâ€”the eastern shoreline and dam area are particularly productive in spring and summer&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>7. Tualatin River &amp; Sloughs</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The south Willamette basin (Eugene-Springfield) offers river and slough fishing for bassâ€”but owner access is common, so a boat helps 
    </li>
    <li>
        Warmwater fishing is good in the bigger lakes and sloughs, with largemouth and smallmouth bass present alongside panfish&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
