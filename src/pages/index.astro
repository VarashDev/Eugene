<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Geography and Waterways
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Eugene’s proximity to the Cascade Mountains, the Pacific Ocean, and the Willamette River means the area boasts a diverse landscape of aquatic habitats. Within a 60-mile radius, you'll find fast-moving trout streams, deep reservoirs for warm-water species, and rich salmon waters heading to the coast.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Fishing Regulations and Licensing
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Oregon fishing requires a valid state fishing license, which can be purchased online through the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://myodfw.com/">Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW)</a>. There are additional tags required for salmon and steelhead, and some waters have specific seasonal closures or limits.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Popularity and Local Culture
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Fishing is not just popular—it's a cultural cornerstone. Eugene hosts local tournaments, kids’ fishing events, and fly-tying workshops. Many locals are involved in conservation efforts to protect native fish populations and maintain clean waterways.
</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl text-teal-900 font-extrabold my-4">
    Top Places to Fish near Eugene, Oregon
</h2>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    McKenzie River
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    The McKenzie River is one of the crown jewels of the Pacific Northwest, offering crystal-clear waters and world-class trout fishing. Fly anglers come for the native redband trout and stocked rainbows. The river is best fished from drift boats, though shore access is available at several points along Highway 126.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Willamette River
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Winding through Eugene, the Willamette River offers year-round fishing for smallmouth bass, Chinook salmon (in season), and even sturgeon further downstream. Popular launch spots include Alton Baker Park and Valley River Center.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Dexter Reservoir
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Just 22 miles southeast of Eugene, Dexter Reservoir is ideal for anglers seeking a family-friendly day on the water. Stocked regularly with rainbow trout, it also provides amenities like boat ramps, picnic areas, and restrooms.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Fern Ridge Reservoir
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    This large reservoir west of Eugene is a hotspot for warm-water fishing—think largemouth bass, crappie, and catfish. It's a great place to fish from a kayak or canoe and is especially productive in late spring and early summer.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Dorena Lake
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Dorena Lake combines fishing with camping, making it perfect for weekend trips. Largemouth bass, rainbow trout, and crappie are the main catches here. Several campgrounds surround the lake, offering easy water access.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Cottage Grove Lake
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    This multipurpose reservoir is known for its consistent fishing opportunities and excellent boat access. Species include bass, bluegill, and stocked trout. Early mornings and evenings in the spring and fall are best.
</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl text-teal-900 font-extrabold my-4">
    Best Fish Species to Target
</h2>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Rainbow Trout
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    These are perhaps the most commonly stocked species around Eugene. Lakes and rivers alike offer ample opportunities. Use PowerBait, worms, or small spinners for best results.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Chinook Salmon
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Spring and fall Chinook runs draw serious anglers. The Willamette and McKenzie rivers see good numbers, especially during high-flow conditions. Use large plugs or drift roe under floats.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Smallmouth Bass
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    The Willamette River's rocky structure makes it prime habitat for these aggressive fighters. Crankbaits, plastic worms, and spinnerbaits work well in warm months.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Crappie and Bluegill
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Great for beginners and kids, these panfish are abundant in Fern Ridge and Dorena. Try small jigs or worms under a bobber for easy success.
</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl text-teal-900 font-extrabold my-4">
   Seasonal Fishing Guide
</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
    Understanding the best times to fish near Eugene, Oregon can significantly improve your chances of landing a catch. Each season brings unique opportunities and challenges.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
   Spring Fishing
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Spring kicks off the active fishing season as water temperatures rise and fish become more aggressive. ODFW begins stocking trout in many lakes and reservoirs, including Dexter and Cottage Grove. Steelhead begin to run up the McKenzie River during this period, making it a prime time for drift boat anglers and fly fishermen.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    Top Tips:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use bright-colored lures or flies as water is often slightly murky.
    </li>
    <li>
        Focus on shallow areas where fish are feeding after winter.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Summer Fishing
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Summer is ideal for warm-water species like bass, bluegill, and crappie. The longer days allow for early morning and evening excursions, which are the most productive times. Reservoirs like Fern Ridge and Dorena are buzzing with activity during this season.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    Top Tips:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Try topwater lures early in the morning.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bring sun protection and plenty of water—temps can soar.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Fall Fishing
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Fall might be the most underrated season for fishing near Eugene. The crowds thin out, but the fish are still active, especially salmon. Chinook begin to return, and trout feed heavily in preparation for winter.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    Top Tips:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use egg patterns or drift eggs for salmon in the rivers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Look for surface activity near inlets and outlets in lakes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
    Winter Fishing
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    While the chill might keep some anglers indoors, hardcore fishers know that winter offers solitude and big rewards. Trout can still be caught in stocked lakes, and steelhead fishing can be productive in the McKenzie and Willamette Rivers.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    Top Tips:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Fish slowly and deep as metabolism slows in cold water.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dress in layers and ensure you have waterproof gear.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-3xl text-teal-900 font-extrabold my-4">
